Smart Manufacturing Monitoring Dashboard (Simulation)
Overview

This project simulates a real-time manufacturing production monitoring system used in smart factory environments.

The system tracks:

Total units produced

Defective units

Quality percentage

Defect percentage

Production shift

Historical logs

Quality trend visualization

Technologies Used

Python

Flask

SQLite

SQLAlchemy

Chart.js

HTML/CSS

System Architecture

Production Data Simulation Engine

Quality Calculation Module

Database Logging System

Alert & Threshold Logic

Real-Time Dashboard Visualization

Quality Formula

Quality Rate (%) =
((Total Units - Defective Units) / Total Units) × 100

Future Improvements

Predictive quality analytics

Defect type classification

REST API endpoints

IoT sensor integration simulation
